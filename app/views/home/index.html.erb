<h1>25/10 Crowdsourcing</h1>
<p class="subhead">Rapidly generate and sift a groupâ€™s most powerful actionable ideas</p>

<p>A tool to support <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/12-2510-crowd-sourcing/">25/10 Crowdsourcing</a> virtually by <a href="https://ko-fi.com/twentyfivetenapp">David Heath</a>.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ol>
  <% if @administrator %>
    <li>Register as an administrator (you're already registered!)</li>
    <li><%= link_to "Create your challenge", new_admin_challenge_path %></li>
  <% else %>
    <li>Register as an administrator (see below)</li>
    <li>Create your challenge</li>
  <% end %>

  <li>Invite participants to propose their solutions, by sharing the unique <em>challenge URL</em> with them</li>
  <li>Wait for all particpants to register and submit their proposals (you'll need to refresh your admin screen to see the numbers change). Once all proposals have been received, you can Open voting. Once voting is open, no new participants can join.</li>
  <li>When voting is open, participants must click to see their first idea to vote on. As the administrator you'll see how many votes have been cast. When you are happy that all votes are cast, you can advance to the next round. If you're doing the activity via video call, you may want to play some music and invite participants to move around to the music for a short while.</li>
  <li>Repeat until all five rounds are complete. You can then close the voting.</li>
  <li>When voting is closed everyone can see the summary. Votes are totalled automatically. If votes were missing for some ideas, then a score out of 25 is extrapolated from the votes that were cast by taking the average score and multiplying by 5.</li>
  <li>That's it!</li>
</ol>

<p>All voting and administration is anonymous. Your identity and that of participants is tracked using a browser cookie <code>_twentyfiveten_session</code>. Participants can only participate in one challenge at a time.</p>
