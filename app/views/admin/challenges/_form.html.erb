    <li>Instead of asking for bold ideas, ask, “If you could unmake one decision that is holding you back, what would it be? What is your first step to unmake it?”</li>
    <li>Instead of bold ideas, ask, “What courageous conversation are you not having? What first step could spark your courage?”</li>
    <li>Instead of bold ideas, ask, “What do you hope can happen in the future? What practical first step can you take now to tip the balance in this direction?”</li>
